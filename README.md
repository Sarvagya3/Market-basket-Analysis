# Market-basket-Analysis

Market Basket Analysis is a modeling technique  based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. The set of items a customer buys is referred to as an itemset, and market basket analysis seeks to find relationships between purchases.

I used Apriori algorithm to find association rules between set of items frequently bought together. To further improve upon the results in larger datasets, one can first apply k means clustering algorithm and then the apriori algorithm to find association rules.
